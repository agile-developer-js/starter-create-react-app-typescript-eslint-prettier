# Easy start of a Typescript/React project

As you know, one of the time consuming steps to create new projects is to do the initial setup.

Here I have made the initial settings to start a project with the **create-react-app** framework.

This starter has the following features:

1. TypeScript
2. ESLint
3. Prettier

To start, just clone this repo and then enter the following command:

`yarn`

or

`npm i`
